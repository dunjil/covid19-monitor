String boutCovid2='''Characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has become deadlier. Rather, it's an acknowledgement of the disease's geographical spread. 
UNICEF has been preparing and responding to the epidemic of COVID-19 around the world, knowing that the virus could spread to children and families in any country or community. UNICEF will continue working with governments and our partners to stop transmission of the virus, and to keep children and their families safe

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it. 
Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. 
These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It's important to remember that key prevention measures are the same - frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin). Also, there is a vaccine for the flu - so remember to keep yourself and your child up to date with vaccinations.

UNICEF is working with the World Health Organization, governments and partners to equip children, pregnant women and their families with the information they need to know on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes the development of online training modules for health workers, and FAQs and guidance for parents, pregnant women and children. 
As of 27 March, UNICEF had shipped more than 4.27 million gloves, 573,300 surgical masks, almost 100,000 N95 respirators, among other supplies, in support of countries as they respond to the pandemic. 
Regionally, UNICEF and partners have reached some 86 million affected people in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia with prevention messages, mainly around handwashing. 
UNICEF is also tackling misinformation about the virus by working with online partners like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok to make sure that accurate advice is available. 
On 25 March, UNICEF announced it had raised its COVID-19 appeal to 651.6 million US Dollars.''';
